# covid-risk-assessment

## 1. What is the problem youâ€™re solving?

Currently, there is no way for us to really measure and assess our risk of getting COVID-19 with our day to day activity. 
## 2. What is the solution?
We want a way to provide a more accurate assessment of our risk of COVID exposure. We will build a web app where a user completes a questionnaire that will calculate their risk based on the activities they have engaged in. 

## 3. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)
- Questionnaire Form 
- Output 

## 4. What are the tough technical challenges involved with solving this problem?
It will be difficult to handle the dynamic data collection as we are essentially building our own algorithm to determine which activities involve the highest risk. 

## 5. What are the stretch goals?
- Send output to personal gmail 
- Login page that stores their information 
- Pulling in COVID data to cross reference their location 

## 6. What is the technology stack?
- React + React Hooks
- Node/Express
- PostgresQL 
- OAuth 
- Bcrypt
